## Running the Project ##
You must have nodejs installed.

The following command will spin up a webserver and listen on port 3000:
	```
	npm start
	```

NOTE: If port 3000 doesn't work for you, you may specify a different port by setting you **PORT** environment variable. The procedure varies based on OS and shell.

NOTE: If you wish to use a different webserver, simply point it at the `/site` directory.
